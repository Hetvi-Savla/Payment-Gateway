                    <p>"It was like a dream to us," says Lilian. She says the people in her community never thought they
                        would have safe water."When people came to tell us about the water project we didn’t believe it
                        would happen – until we saw people actually constructing the water system," Lilian says. "Now we
                        have water a few meters from our houses!" </p>

                        water to properly cook their food.""This solution would waste time and made it difficult to prosper," Maria shares. "We were spending all
                        our money on the most basic substance – water." </p>
